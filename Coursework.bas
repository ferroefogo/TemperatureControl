;Program To take in temperature reading and turn on the fan or the heater based on the level of temperature

;TODO:
;	Get the DAC setup and working with analogue values. (The DAC must output the correct analogue voltage to the heater, based on the analogue value of the ADC)
;	Get the switches, instead of buttons, working for the fan override system, because the override must stay on when its pressed or switched, and stay off when pressed off.
;	Develop the time delay as a seperate label that can be called to get more marks. This delay is added to avoid user spam that could lead to damaging the moving parts of the fan. /DONE

;Simulation Assumptions:
	;A.0 is the analogue reading of the room temperature
	;A.1 is the digital button input for the fan override
	;A.2 is the digital button input for the heater
	;B.0 is the copied analogue reading of the room temperature
	;B.1 connects to the fan
	;B.2 is the copied analogue reading of the temperature dial (potentiometer)
	;B.3 connects to the heater
	;B.4 connects an LED that shows if the system is running manually (on override)
	
	;A.0 reading scale: - Numbers will be changed based on the real values that the thermistor divider produces with a limited range using fixed resistors.
	;	0 is less than or equal to 10 degrees
	;	128 is exactly 20 degrees
	;	255 is greater than or equal to 30 degrees
	;	Pivot around 128 (20 degrees)
	
	;A.2 reading scale: - Numbers will be changed based on the real values that the thermistor divider produces with a limited range using fixed resistors.
	;	0 is heater off
	;	50 is ~10 degrees
	;	100 is ~15 degrees
	;	150 is ~20 degrees
	;	200 is ~25 degrees
	;	250 is ~30 degrees
